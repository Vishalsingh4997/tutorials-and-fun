Since the code is based on p5.js I recommend you to either use the code editor here:- https://editor.p5js.org/ or setup the environment!
Code goes here:-

let x,y,xspeed,yspeed;
let steem;
let counter = 0;


function setup() {
  createCanvas(620, 400);
	x=320;
	y=200;
	xspeed=2;
	yspeed=2;
	steem = loadImage("steem1.png"); //setting path of png
}

function draw() {
  background(1);
	fill(256);
	text("Steem Hits :-  "+counter, 10, 20); //setting text along with x,y positions

	image(steem,x,y); //loading image
	x = x + xspeed;
	y = y + yspeed;
	if(x + steem.width == width || x == 0){
	xspeed = - xspeed;
		counter=counter+1; //setting counter on hit
		}
	
	if(y + steem.height == height || y == 0){
		yspeed =  -yspeed;
				counter=counter+1;

				}
}
